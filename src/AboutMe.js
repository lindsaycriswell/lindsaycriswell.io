        I am a full stack web developer dedicated to creating innovative web
        experiences that help users engage with their passions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I see programming as both a thrilling problem-solving exercise and a
        creative outlet for exploring my interests and sharing them with others.
      </p>
      <p>I'm a California expat living in New York City.</p>
      <p>
        In my free time you can find me planning/daydreaming about traveling the
        world, concocting something delicious in the kitchen, knitting blankets
        modelled on abstract art, or watching Jeopardy! with a pint of dank IPA.
